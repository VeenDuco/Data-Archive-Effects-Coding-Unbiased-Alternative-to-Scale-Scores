## Data Archive Explanation

This data archive contains all necessary files to replicate the study for the manuscript ”Effects Coding as Unbiased Alternative to Scale Scores”.

All files and documents are archived and described by [Duco Veen](www.ducoveen.com). 

### Key File Descriptions

1. [Simulation_function_2factor.R](https://github.com/VeenDuco/Data-Archive-Effects-Coding-Unbiased-Alternative-to-Scale-Scores/blob/master/Simulation_function_2factor.R) R script that contains a function to generate data according to the two factor model with 3 manifest variables each. 
2. [simulation1_2factor.R](https://github.com/VeenDuco/Data-Archive-Effects-Coding-Unbiased-Alternative-to-Scale-Scores/blob/master/simulation1_2factor.R) R script that carries out simulation study one and produces Figures 5. 
3. [magnitude_of_effect.R](https://github.com/VeenDuco/Data-Archive-Effects-Coding-Unbiased-Alternative-to-Scale-Scores/blob/master/magnitude_of_effect.R) R script that investigated the magnitude of the effect of simulation study one. Produces, amongst others, Figures 6 and 7 in the manuscript.
4. [regression_example_sim_2factor.R](https://github.com/VeenDuco/Data-Archive-Effects-Coding-Unbiased-Alternative-to-Scale-Scores/blob/master/regression_example_sim_2factor.R) R script that carries out simulation study two and produces Figures 8 and 9 and the results for Table 1.
5. [LGCM_example_2factor.R](https://github.com/VeenDuco/Data-Archive-Effects-Coding-Unbiased-Alternative-to-Scale-Scores/blob/master/LGCM_example_2factor.R) Wil run the simulation for the third simulation study. This study concerns latent growth curve models with factor scores as distal outcomes. The results of Table 2 will be generated.
